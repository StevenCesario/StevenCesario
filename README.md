# Steven Cesario
### Co-Founder @ ClarityTracking | API Integration Architect

I solve the **#1 pain point** for modern advertisers: conversion data loss from broken Meta CAPI tracking.

Advertisers are "flying blind" post-iOS 14, losing 40-50% of their data and struggling with 4/10 Event Match Quality (EMQ) scores. My "white-glove" service implements a production-grade, full-stack architecture that solves this permanently.

### 🏆 The "Golden Case Study" (My Core Proof of Work)

By implementing my full-stack CAPI system, I took one client from a **~5.0 EMQ to 9.3/10 in 24 hours**.

* **The Result:** **5.15x True ROAS** by feeding Meta's algorithm accurate data.
* **The Scale:** Allowed the client to confidently scale ad spend to **$43k in 45 days**.
* **The "How":** This is the system I sell. My portfolio *is* the blueprint.

## 🚀 My Core System & Proof of Work

My portfolio is strategically organized to de-risk me for my clients. It proves I am not just a script-builder, but a **System Architect**.

### [1. 💡 ClarityTracking: The Core System Blueprint](https://github.com/StevenCesario/claritytracking-public-demo)

This is my flagship: the **v1.0 Production Architecture** I use to deliver my "Golden Case Study" results.

* **Full-Stack:** FastAPI backend, React frontend dashboard.
* **Multi-Tenant:** Secure JWT auth and database models (`User` -> `Website` -> `Connection`) built for a real SaaS.
* **Data Pipeline:** Includes the `EventLog` table and analytics (`get_potential_duplicate_events`) to monitor and ensure data integrity.

### [2. 🎮 xecution.ai-api-demo: Proof of Production-grade FastAPI Skills](https://github.com/StevenCesario/xecution.ai-api-demo)

While the domain is different, this is supporting proof of my mastery of the core stack. It demonstrates I can build secure, complex, production-grade applications from scratch.

* **Core Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic V2.
* **Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (services, crud, models).
* **Production-Ready:** Secure JWT auth, Alembic migrations, and a full Pytest suite.

### [3. 📦 e-commerce-integration-demo: Proof of Complex Webhook Integration](https://github.com/StevenCesario/e-commerce-integration-demo)

This is supporting proof of my ability to handle high-stakes, asynchronous data from third-party platforms (like GoHighLevel, Shopify, or Skool). This project eliminated **15+ hours of weekly manual work** for a client.

* **Webhook Driven:** Production-ready API for ingesting and processing webhook data.
* **Data Transformation:** Securely maps complex, nested JSON (including PII) from one API format to another.
* **Reliability:** Uses Pydantic V2 for rigorous data validation and error handling.

## 🛠️ Core Technical Stack
* **Core:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic V2
* **Specializations:** Server-Side Tracking (Meta CAPI), API Architecture, Webhook Automation
* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
* **DevOps:** Docker, Alembic, Pytest, GitHub Actions
* **Certifications:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
